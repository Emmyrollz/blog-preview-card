## Overview

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Solution URL: https://github.com/Emmyrollz/blog-preview-card
- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I focused on using **HTML & CSS** foundations to structure and style the card. I used **CSS Grid** to align the card content and applied hover effects on the blog card. I also learned how to import and use the **Figtree** font from Google Fonts to enhance typography.

Hereâ€™s an example of the CSS hover effect I implemented on the blog card:

```css
.blog-container:hover {
  box-shadow: 10px 10px 0 black;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to explore more **CSS** functionalities to add interactivity, and further refine my responsive design approach using **CSS media queries**.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This guide was incredibly helpful for understanding how to effectively use CSS Grid to structure the page.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Figtree) - Used this for adding modern typography to the blog card.
